29485353,Seasonal influenza vaccine in immunocompromised persons.,Hum Vaccin Immunother,"Immunocompromised persons are at high risk of complications from influenza infection. This population includes those with solid organ transplants, hematopoietic stem cell transplants, solid cancers and hematologic malignancy as well as those with autoimmune conditions receiving biologic therapies. In this review, we discuss the impact of influenza infection and evidence for vaccine effectiveness and immunogenicity. Overall, lower respiratory disease from influenza is common; however, vaccine immunogenicity is low. Despite this, in some populations, influenza vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing severe disease. Various strategies to improve influenza vaccine immunogenicity have been attempted including two vaccine doses in the same influenza season, intradermal, adjuvanted, and high-dose vaccines. The timing of influenza vaccine is also important to achieve optimal immunogenicity. Given the suboptimal immunogenicity, family members and healthcare professionals involved in the care of these populations should be vaccinated. Health care professional recommendation for vaccination is an important factor in vaccine coverage.",2018,Bosaeed M and Kumar D. Seasonal influenza vaccine in immunocompromised persons.

36052083,The role of cell-mediated immunity against influenza and its implications for vaccine evaluation.,Front Immunol,"Influenza vaccines remain the most effective tools to prevent flu and its complications. Trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines primarily elicit antibodies towards haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. These vaccines fail to induce high protective efficacy, in particular in older adults and immunocompromised individuals and require annual updates to keep up with evolving influenza strains (antigenic drift). Vaccine efficacy declines when there is a mismatch between its content and circulating strains. Current correlates of protection are merely based on serological parameters determined by haemagglutination inhibition or single radial haemolysis assays. However, there is ample evidence showing that these serological correlates of protection can both over- or underestimate the protective efficacy of influenza vaccines.

33615750,Comparison of COVID-19 and influenza characteristics.,J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,"The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) not only poses a serious threat to the health of people worldwide but also affects the global economy. The outbreak of COVID-19 began in December 2019, at the same time as the influenza season. However, as the treatments and prognoses of COVID-19 and influenza are different, it is important to accurately differentiate these two different respiratory tract infections on the basis of their respective early-stage characteristics. We reviewed official documents and news released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), the United States CDC, and the World Health Organization (WHO), and we also searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica database (Embase), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, preprinted bioRxiv and medRxiv databases for documents and guidelines from earliest available date up until October 3rd, 2020. We obtained the latest information about COVID-19 and influenza and summarized and compared their biological characteristics, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathological mechanisms, treatments, and prognostic factors. We show that although COVID-19 and influenza are different in many ways, there are numerous similarities; thus, in addition to using nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody-based approaches, clinicians and epidemiologists should distinguish between the two using their respective characteristics in early stages. We should utilize experiences from other epidemics to provide additional guidance for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.",2021,Bai Y and Tao X.

34921092,"Influenza and morbidity and mortality risk in patients in Mexico with systemic arterial hypertension alone or with comorbidities: a retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study from 2014 to 2020.",BMJ Open,"OBJECTIVES: In Mexico, patients with systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) are excluded from the influenza vaccination programme despite their risk of cardiovascular events as influenza-related complications. We investigated the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality in patients with SAH.
DESIGN: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study that analysed data from early 2014 to mid-2020.
SETTING: Data were obtained from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico database.
PARTICIPANTS: 32 663 cases of influenza in people aged ≥20 years with a confirmed case of influenza-like illness, severe respiratory infection and/or influenza death were investigated.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Influenza deaths, hospitalisation frequency and the impact on hospitalisation and/or death due to influenza by the SAH variate alone and in combination with diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease and/or smoking, and by vaccination status were assessed.
RESULTS: The hospitalisation frequency increased with age. Notably, 46.0% (15 033/32 663) of confirmed influenza cases had at least one comorbidity, with SAH (19.2%; 6260/32 663) and obesity (18.7%; 6106/32 663) being the most prevalent. Most confirmed SAH cases (80.8%; 5057/6260) were in those who had not been vaccinated against influenza. There were 3496 deaths due to influenza (mortality rate, 0.69×1 00 000 inhabitants), with the highest rates seen in those aged ≥80 years (80-89 years, 2.0%; ≥90 years, 3.6%). The case fatality rate due to influenza and SAH was significantly higher than those due to influenza without SAH in those aged <50 years, but not in the other age groups (20-29 years, 9.8%, p<0.0005; 30-39 years, 8.2%, p<0.035; 40-49 years, 17.8%, p<0.0005; vs 15.1%-20.0%, p=0.31-0.99 for those aged ≥50 years).

32725087,"Description and comparison of demographic characteristics and comorbidities in SARI from COVID-19, SARI from influenza, and the Brazilian general population.",Cad Saude Publica,"The study aims to describe patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) due to COVID-19 (SARI-COVID) in Brazil according to demographic characteristics and comorbidities up to the 21st Epidemiological Week of 2020. The study aimed to compare these characteristics with those of patients hospitalized for SARI due to influenza in 2019/2020 (SARI-FLU) and with the Brazilian general population. The proportions of demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and pregnant and postpartum women among patients hospitalized for SARI-COVID and SARI-FLU were obtained from the SIVEP-Gripe database, and the estimates for the Brazilian population were obtained from the population projections performed by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Information System on Live Birth data, and nationwide surveys. Compared to the Brazilian population, patients hospitalized for SARI-COVID showed a higher proportion of males, elderly individuals and those aged 40 to 59 years, comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic lung diseases), and pregnant/postpartum women. Compared to the general population, Brazilians hospitalized for SARI-FLU showed higher prevalence rates of ages 0 to 4 years or over 60 years, white race/color, comorbidities (diabetes, chronic kidney disease, asthma, and other chronic lung diseases), and pregnant/postpartum women.

34140009,Structural inequities in seasonal influenza vaccination rates.,BMC Public Health,"BACKGROUND: Influenza immunization is a highly effective method of reducing illness, hospitalization and mortality from this disease. However, influenza vaccination rates in the U.S. remain below public health targets and persistent structural inequities reduce the likelihood that Black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Latina/o, Asian groups, and populations of low socioeconomic status will receive the influenza vaccine.
METHODS: We analyzed correlates of influenza vaccination rates using the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in the year 2020. Our analysis compared influenza vaccination as the outcome of interest with the variables age, sex, race, education, income, geographic location, health insurance status, access to primary care, history of delaying care due to cost, and comorbidities such as: asthma, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, body mass index, cancer and diabetes.
RESULTS: Non-Hispanic White (46.5%) and Asian (44.1%) participants are more likely to receive the influenza vaccine compared to Non-Hispanic Black (36.7%), Hispanic (33.9%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (36.6%), and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (37.9%) participants. We found persistent structural inequities that predict influenza vaccination, within and across racial and ethnic groups, including not having health insurance [OR: 0.51 (0.47-0.55)], not having regular access to primary care [OR: 0.50 (0.48-0.52)], and the need to delay medical care due to cost [OR: 0.75 (0.71-0.79)].
CONCLUSION: As COVID-19 vaccination efforts evolve, it is important for physicians and policymakers to identify the structural impediments to equitable U.S. influenza vaccination so that future vaccination campaigns are not impeded by these barriers to immunization.",2021,"Brewer LI, et al.

28468650,Seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with COPD: a systematic literature review.,BMC Pulm Med,"BACKGROUND: Influenza is a frequent cause of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exacerbations are associated with worsening of the airflow obstruction, hospitalisation, reduced quality of life, disease progression, death, and ultimately, substantial healthcare-related costs. Despite longstanding recommendations to vaccinate vulnerable high-risk groups against seasonal influenza, including patients with COPD, vaccination rates remain sub-optimal in this population.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to summarise current evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies on the immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with COPD. The selection of relevant articles was based on a three-step selection procedure according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search yielded 650 unique hits of which 48 eligible articles were screened in full-text.
RESULTS: Seventeen articles describing 13 different studies were found to be pertinent to this review. Results of four RCTs and one observational study demonstrate that seasonal influenza vaccination is immunogenic in patients with COPD. Two studies assessed the occurrence of COPD exacerbations 14 days after influenza vaccination and found no evidence of an increased risk of exacerbation. Three RCTs showed no significant difference in the occurrence of systemic effects between groups receiving influenza vaccine or placebo. Six out of seven studies on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness indicated long-term benefits of seasonal influenza vaccination, such as reduced number of exacerbations, reduced hospitalisations and outpatient visits, and decreased all-cause and respiratory mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional large and well-designed observational studies would contribute to understanding the impact of disease severity and patient characteristics on the response to influenza vaccination. Overall, the evidence supports a positive benefit-risk ratio for seasonal influenza vaccination in patients with COPD, and supports current vaccination recommendations in this population.",2017,"Bekkat-Berkani R, et al.

31814718,Improving Influenza Vaccination Coverage Among Patients With COPD: A Pilot Project.,Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) advocate regular influenza vaccination, which has been shown to reduce exacerbations. However, influenza vaccination rates remain low. This quality improvement project was initiated to help improve influenza vaccination rates in a tertiary hospital.
METHODS: All patients with COPD in the airway program (TAP) in the National University Hospital at the end of 2013 were recruited. The interventions were implemented in 2014; thus, population was stratified into the pre-intervention group and post-intervention group. Those who died in 2014 were excluded. They were (1) patient education posters in the clinics on the need for regular influenza vaccination, (2) direct interventions by physicians, and (3) intervention by the nurses when vaccinations were neglected. Physicians were made aware of previous vaccination rates, vaccination card reminders were placed in the clinics, and a new electronic healthcare record system (EHR) was implemented. The patients were followed up till the end of 2015 or until death. When an influenza vaccination was administered, the patients were asked which of the interventions led to the vaccination. A questionnaire was delivered to the physicians to determine the interventions that led to any change in vaccination prescription practices.
RESULTS: The pre-intervention influenza vaccination rate was low at 47.7%. The post-intervention influenza vaccination rate improved to 80.7% with the multi-pronged approach. Physicians initiated the majority of vaccinations (87.9%), while nurses helped intervene in a further 12.1%. Physicians' vaccination prescription practices changed as a result of self-awareness of low vaccination rates, vaccination card reminders, and the new EHR. Patient education made minimal impact.
CONCLUSION: This project demonstrates that with regular audits to track progress and several easy-to-implement interventions, improving influenza vaccination rates is an achievable goal.",2019,"Li A, et al.

Vaccination is still the best option to prevent influenza virus infection. Different types of influenza vaccines, including live attenuated virus vaccines, inactivated whole virus vaccines, virosome vaccines, split-virion vaccines and subunit vaccines have been developed. However, they have several limitations, such as the relatively high manufacturing cost and long production time, moderate efficacy of some of the vaccines in certain populations, and lack of cross-reactivity. These are some of the problems that need to be solved. Here, we summarized recent advances in the development and application of different types of influenza vaccines, including the recent development of viral vectored influenza vaccines.
